Is the image original? Any signs of manipulation?

The metadata shows several history entries and multiple editing software (Adobe Premiere Pro, GIMP), as well as evidence of compositing from source files. The file is actually a JPEG, not PNG as named, all of which strongly indicate the image is not original and has gone through significant manipulation.
